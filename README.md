# Mesuring Time Complexity - Report

This was originally an assignment for the COMP1201-Algorithmics module taught at the 
School of Electronics and Computer Science at the University of Southampton.

This report is a Time Complexity analysis of different sorting algorithms. 
It is divided up in three parts, each of which takes into consideration
different algorithms written in Java and C++ language.

## 1. Java Sorting Algorithms

In the first part of the report, it is taken into consideration the time complexity of:
- Insertion sort
- Quick sort
- Shell sort

Each algorithm can be found in the "supporting code" folder. 
These algorithms are all implemented with Java.

## 2. Measuring Complexity of Graph-Colouring Solver

In this part the time complexity with Big-O notation is calculated for a 
Graph-Colouring solver algorithm.

## 3. Java and C++

Three different sorting programs are run, two are Java programs and the other one is written in C++.
